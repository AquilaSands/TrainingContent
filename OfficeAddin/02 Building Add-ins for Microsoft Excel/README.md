# Office Add-ins: Build Office Add-ins for Excel

Microsoft Office clients enable developers to create add-ins that extend Microsoft Excel with custom functionality. Through a JavaScript API, developers can manipulate the content in an Excel workbook from an app running in the task pane.

In this module, you'll learn how to build an Excel add-in that inserts (and replaces) text ranges, tables, charts, and dialogs.

> This module is also published as a Microsoft Learn module: [Build Office Add-ins for Excel](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/office-add-ins-excel).

## Lab

The lab for this module is available in multiple units within the associated Microsoft Learn module. Use the following links to jump to the specific unit. Each Microsoft Learn unit represents a different lab exercise & demo in the presentation.

- [Exercise - Work with tables and charts in Excel Add-ins](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/office-add-ins-excel/3-exercise-tables-charts)

  In this exercise, you'll learn how to work with tables and charts using the Office.js Excel JavaScript API. After creating a table, you'll learn how you can apply sorting and filtering actions on the data within the table. You'll also learn how to create and edit charts in the workbook using from your custom Excel add-in.

- [Exercise - Work with worksheets and add-in commands](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/office-add-ins-excel/5-exercise-worksheets-commands)

  In this exercise, you'll learn how to freeze the header row of the table that you previously created, so that it remains visible even as the user scrolls down the worksheet. You'll also learn how to toggle worksheet protection on and off.

- [Exercise - Work with dialogs in Excel](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/office-add-ins-excel/7-exercise-dialogs)

  In this exercise, you'll open a dialog in your add-in, pass a message from the dialog process to the task pane process, and close the dialog.
