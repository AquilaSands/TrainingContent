# Using Single Sign-On with Office Add-ins

The Microsoft identity platform enables developers to build many different types of applications to satisfy diverse business requirements and different scenarios. By supporting multiple OAuth 2.0 standard authentication protocols, developers can create different types of applications that meet business needs including single page applications, web apps, mobile or native apps, and services or daemon apps. In this module, you'll learn how you can implement different authentication protocols in popular application types.
